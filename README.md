# Tic-Tac-Toe
I have used HTML, CSS, and JS while working on this project.

For responsiveness, I have used Media Query.

I have used a ringtone so that when a user clicks on the table button it plays the sound.

I have made this project fully responsive using Media Query.

I have used a gif that displays on the screen when the user won the match.
